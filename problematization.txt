Problems with CVs
People have thousands of them to read through:
Therefore
    Grab the attention of the person reading it.

    Present it in such a way that they can easily find the information that they are looking for.
        -Organize by topics
        -Provide additional information if a topic is selected e.g under communication you can write these are my weakness these are my strengths.
        %Feature
          Use tags to specify under what topic a line in the cv should go under. Otherwise it stays in the regular cv.

Once a potential candidate is found lots of interviews need to be conducted. Sometimes employers may ask questions to further narrow this down.
Therefore
    -A CV which allows easy back and forth communication is ideal. Ideally, clarification will need to be made and this will reflect all future versions of the cv.
     There may also come a time when they need specific details not usually needed. These can be displayed an filtered by hash tags once some one asks a question.
     It will be up to the CV owner to organise these when necessary(a count of times requested will also be available which will be incremented each time it is retagged or
     when the importance label is voted on by a user of the system.

A role may not be clearly communicated in a CV
Therefore
    -Allow cvs to be tagged with roles e.g. consultant, project manager etc.
    -Allow cv to also be tagged by skills used in roles.

People can lie on their CVS
Therefore
    -Allow qualifications to be posted. Endorsements don't work like on linkedin because people can lie and it becomes very political.
    -Allow likes since that is essentially what endorsements have become. People obtain likes when people enjoy working with them.
    -Endorsements should be permitted from third party training facilities along with regular endorsements. This should help mitigate lying
    and make endorsements more valuable.

Such a system has limitations depending on the size of its userbase
Therefore
    -Allow facebook google and if possible linkedin login.
