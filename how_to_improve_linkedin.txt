News Feed is quite busy. This is for revenue though, is there something that can be done here?

Profile:
There is a lot of space wasted by the sidebar. These things need to be moved somewhere.

Make endorsing less obnoxious yet still visible.

Group certifications by company or expertise. Make logos less obnoxious.

Experimental feature of grouping a candidate by skills.


Don't display everything at once. Use expandable containers instead. So for background make people
give a summary that fits within a certain amount of characters.

Connections could be better. Text and image should be in a box. Last word of each sentence should line up against the end of it.
Have ways to categorize connections based on the way that they have interacted with the profile. This should be possible but is
probably quite hard to implement in a good way.

Not Everything needs to be separated. Groups and following could be in the same box.

I feel like a fade in effect for extra details like groups and things you are following would help with it all feeling clumped together.

Use people similar and people viewed in one block next to profile pic and info. Call it recommended people and give it a little arrow
underneath it to allow people to look for more people.

It feels unnatural to have a profile info underneath anything. Skills or expertise should be underneath it.

Fonts could be better, try helvetica? Also use some tricks like firefox has a thing
that makes fonts clearer when selected.

Categories should not be movable. Recruiters should decide on what they want to see first.

Plugins for certain categories? Publications could be auto updated based on their popularity.
